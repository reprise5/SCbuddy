# SCbuddy
Supercompost Buddy for OSRS.  It helps you keep tabs on the levels of your supercompost bins in the game.  If you care to keep track and hate using paper. 

If you're on Linux, the code in the repository already is capable of loading from a config file upon starting the program, and saving to the file when you hit enter (or Actions>submit).  It is not part of the Compiled program, so if you want it, just uncomment the code labeled "specific to me" and run `ant ` from within this repository (as a folder on your computer) yourself from your terminal.  

I could upload a windows **and** Linux binary that have that capability in it.
